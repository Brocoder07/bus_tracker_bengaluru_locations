The first file bengalurulocations only contains some places in bangalore city with their coordinates extracted using geocoding.
The second file is the original code which you can run in any java IDE (eclipse not recommended) but beware the input only takes two places mentioned in the first file and nothing else.
This is a sample tracker of a bus moving along the city of bangalore. This is solely built using java swings and awt.
These files are a part of a project that I worked on called metro and bus booking system and tracker and is a prototype build.
